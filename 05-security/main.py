# =======================================================================
#
#  üéüÔ∏è Welcome to the Secure Concert API - A Simplified Security Demo üéüÔ∏è
#
#  This FastAPI application demonstrates core security principles in a
#  clear and concise way, using a "concert ticket" analogy. We've
#  stripped away complex logic to focus purely on HOW to implement security.
#
#  Each section is numbered and explained to guide you through the concepts.
#
# =======================================================================

# --- 1. CORE SECURITY CONFIGURATION ---
# This is where we set up the fundamental tools for our security system.

# For hashing passwords. We use 'bcrypt', a strong, industry-standard algorithm.
# When a user registers for a ticket, we don't store their password "12345".
# Instead, we store the bcrypt hash, like "$2b$12$Eix...". This is a one-way process.
# If our database is ever stolen, the attackers can't see the real passwords.
pwd_context = CryptContext(schemes=["bcrypt"], deprecated="auto")

# This is the secret key used to sign our JSON Web Tokens (JWTs).
#
# JWT (JSON Web Token) and Bearer Token Explained:
# Imagine a JWT is your digital concert ticket. When you log in (get your ticket),
# the server gives you this ticket, which contains who you are, when it expires,
# and a special digital seal (signature) using this SECRET_KEY.
# This seal proves the ticket is genuine and untampered.
#
# The "Bearer Token" concept is how you present this ticket. For future requests to protected areas
# (like getting backstage access), you send your JWT in the "Authorization" header
# like "Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_JWT>".
# "Bearer" simply means "The holder of this token is authorized."
SECRET_KEY = "a-very-secret-key-that-should-be-in-a-env-file"
ALGORITHM = "HS256"  # The specific cryptographic algorithm to sign the JWT.
ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES = 30  # How long a token is valid after being issued.

# This object tells FastAPI two things about our login system:
# 1. It expects the client to send a token in the "Authorization" header
#    in the format "Bearer <token>".
# 2. It specifies the URL where the client can go to get a token (`/auth/login`).
#    This is used by the interactive API docs (Swagger UI).
oauth2_scheme = OAuth2PasswordBearer(tokenUrl="auth/login")

# We use 'slowapi' to implement rate limiting. This is a crucial defense
# against brute-force attacks, where an attacker tries to guess passwords
# by sending thousands of login requests per second.
limiter = Limiter(key_func=get_remote_address)


# --- 2. FASTAPI APP INITIALIZATION ---

app = FastAPI(
    title="üéüÔ∏è Secure Concert API - Simplified Security Demo",
    description="""
    Learn FastAPI security with a simple concert ticket example!

    This application demonstrates the following core security concepts:

    * üîê **Authentication**: Using JWTs as "digital tickets" for secure login. A user proves who they are.
    * üõ°Ô∏è **Authorization**: Using Role-Based Access Control (RBAC). Once authenticated, we check what the user is *allowed* to do (e.g., access the guest list).
    * üîë **Password Security**: Never storing plain text passwords by using strong hashing.
    * ‚ö° **Rate Limiting**: Protecting login endpoints from automated brute-force attacks.

# This provides automatic input validation, preventing many common vulnerabilities.
