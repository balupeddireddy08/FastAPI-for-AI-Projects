# --- 1. CORE SECURITY CONFIGURATION ---
# This is where we set up the fundamental tools for our security system.

# For hashing passwords. We use 'bcrypt', a strong, industry-standard algorithm.
# When a user registers for a ticket, we don't store their password "12345".
# Instead, we store the bcrypt hash, like "$2b$12$Eix...". This is a one-way process.
# If our database is ever stolen, the attackers can't see the real passwords.
pwd_context = CryptContext(schemes=["bcrypt"], deprecated="auto")

# This is the secret key used to sign our JSON Web Tokens (JWTs).
#
# JWT (JSON Web Token) and Bearer Token Explained:
# Imagine a JWT is your digital concert ticket. When you log in (get your ticket),
# the server gives you this ticket, which contains who you are, when it expires,
# and a special digital seal (signature) using this SECRET_KEY.
# This seal proves the ticket is genuine and untampered.
#
# The "Bearer Token" concept is how you present this ticket. For future requests to protected areas
# (like getting backstage access), you send your JWT in the "Authorization" header
# like "Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_JWT>".
# "Bearer" simply means "The holder of this token is authorized."
SECRET_KEY = "a-very-secret-key-that-should-be-in-a-env-file"
ALGORITHM = "HS256"  # The specific cryptographic algorithm to sign the JWT.
ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES = 30  # How long a token is valid after being issued.

# We'll use HTTPBearer for a direct 'Access Token' input in Swagger UI.
# OAuth2PasswordBearer will still be used for the /auth/login path's documentation
# and for the actual token parsing logic.
oauth2_scheme = OAuth2PasswordBearer(
    tokenUrl="auth/login",
            scopes={
            "me": "Read information about the current user."
        }
)

# Define an HTTPBearer instance for direct token input in Swagger UI
bearer_scheme = HTTPBearer()  # This automatically looks for "Bearer <token>" in Authorization header
# --- CHANGE ENDS HERE ---

# We use 'slowapi' to implement rate limiting. This is a crucial defense
# against brute-force attacks, where an attacker tries to guess passwords
# by sending thousands of login requests per second.

    * üîí **Simple Security**: Focus on basic authentication without complex authorization rules.
    * üîë **Password Security**: Never storing plain text passwords by using strong hashing.
    * ‚ö° **Rate Limiting**: Protecting login endpoints from automated brute-force attacks.
