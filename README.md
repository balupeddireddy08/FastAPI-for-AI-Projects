## About FastAPI

FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance) web framework for building APIs with Python based on standard Python type hints. It's particularly well-suited for AI applications due to its:

- Speed and performance
- Automatic data validation
- Interactive documentation
- Asynchronous support
- Easy integration with AI models

This tutorial series will show you how to leverage these features to build robust AI-powered applications.
