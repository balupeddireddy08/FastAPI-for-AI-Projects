## 📊 Visual Learning with Diagrams

Each tutorial now includes **interactive diagrams** that visually explain key FastAPI concepts! These visual aids help you:

- Understand complex concepts more intuitively
- See the flow of data through your API
- Grasp relationships between different components
- Visualize architectural patterns

The diagrams use Mermaid syntax for clarity and are embedded directly in the README files, making it easy to follow along as you build each project.

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Install FastAPI and server
pip install fastapi uvicorn

# Clone this repository and navigate to any section
