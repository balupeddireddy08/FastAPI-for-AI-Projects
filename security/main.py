# =======================================================================
#
#  üè¶ Welcome to SecureBank - A Simplified Security Demo üè¶
#
#  This FastAPI application demonstrates core security principles in a
#  clear and concise way, perfect for beginners. We've stripped away
#  complex business logic to focus purely on HOW to implement security.
#
#  Each section is numbered and explained to guide you through the concepts.
#
# =======================================================================

# --- 1. CORE SECURITY CONFIGURATION ---
# This is where we set up the fundamental tools for our security system.

# For hashing passwords. We use 'bcrypt', a strong, industry-standard algorithm.
# When a user signs up, we don't store their password "12345". Instead, we
# store the bcrypt hash, like "$2b$12$Eix...". This is a one-way process.
# If our database is ever stolen, the attackers can't see the real passwords.
pwd_context = CryptContext(schemes=["bcrypt"], deprecated="auto")

# This is the secret key used to sign our JSON Web Tokens (JWTs).
# Think of it as the "master key" for our authentication system.
# The signature ensures that tokens haven't been tampered with.
# IMPORTANT: In a real app, this MUST be a long, random string loaded
# from a secure environment variable, not hardcoded!
SECRET_KEY = "a-very-secret-key-that-should-be-in-a-env-file"
ALGORITHM = "HS256"  # The specific cryptographic algorithm to sign the JWT.
ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES = 30  # How long a token is valid after being issued.

# This object tells FastAPI two things about our login system:
# 1. It expects the client to send a token in the "Authorization" header
#    in the format "Bearer <token>".
# 2. It specifies the URL where the client can go to get a token (`/auth/login`).
#    FastAPI uses this for the interactive API docs (like Swagger UI).
oauth2_scheme = OAuth2PasswordBearer(tokenUrl="auth/login")

# We use 'slowapi' to implement rate limiting. This is a crucial defense
# against brute-force attacks, where an attacker tries to guess passwords
# by sending thousands of login requests per second.
# `get_remote_address` uses the client's IP address as a unique identifier.
limiter = Limiter(key_func=get_remote_address)


# --- 2. FASTAPI APP INITIALIZATION ---

app = FastAPI(
    title="üè¶ SecureBank - Simplified Security Demo",
    description="""
    Learn FastAPI security with a simple banking example!

    This application demonstrates the following core security concepts:

    * üîê **Authentication**: Using JWT tokens for secure login. A user proves who they are.
    * üõ°Ô∏è **Authorization**: Using Role-Based Access Control (RBAC). Once authenticated, we check what the user is *allowed* to do.
    * üîë **Password Security**: Never storing plain text passwords by using strong hashing.
    * ‚ö° **Rate Limiting**: Protecting login endpoints from automated brute-force attacks.
    * üìù **Audit Logging**: Keeping a record of important security-related events.

# error if a client exceeds the defined limits.

# --- 3. DATA MODELS (PYDANTIC) ---
# Pydantic models define the structure and data types for our API.
# This is our first and most important line of defense for input validation.
# It automatically prevents many common vulnerabilities by ensuring
# that incoming data is in the correct format.
